  description: ACM National, the Association for Computing Machinery, was founded
    in 1947 for the advancement of computing as a science and a profession, and has
    become the world's largest computing society. We're here to bring it to UT Dallas
    in style. Enjoy coding, technology, networking (both kinds), and tons of fun?
    Come on in. At ACM, you'll everything from industry events, workshops, UTD's
    top student hackathon, LAN parties, and more. HackUTD is the official student
    hackathon of UT Dallas, and North Texas' largest university hackathon, run by
    ACM in partnership with Major League Hacking. Students come from all around the
    nation to UTD to code, build, and create incredible things in 24 hours. ACM Projects
    is a semester-long opportunity for new engineering and computer science students
    to learn about software engineering principles in a project-oriented fashion.
    Due to the overwhelming success and interest in ACM Projects, ACM Ignite was
    created for the more experienced students. It provides a similar team opportunity
    to create and develop a project, but the environment is more self-guided and
    self-driven compared to the guidance given to Projects participants. Interested
    in research as an undergrad? Look no further! Come check out our new ACM research
    division, where students are partnered with professors to undertake a semester-long
    research project, with the end goal of a poster proposal and continuing the research
    in the future. Last but not least, ACM Education has great plans for outreach
    and volunteer opportunities for the upcoming 2019-2020 school year. Come out
    to our events, learn different things, and get involved!
