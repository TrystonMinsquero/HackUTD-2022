  description: "We at A3 are the official anime club of UT Dallas. We welcome all
    UTD students, staff, alumni, or acquaintances of the aforementioned groups. Although
    anyone can watch anime in the comfort of their own homes, watching with others
    is also a great way to enjoy shows! We at A3 feel this sense of camaraderie is
    one of our greatest strengths. Everyone tends to have a wide array of tastes,
    yet we all come together to enjoy the same shows. Aside from shows, our other
    activities include Kahoot trivia nights, Iron Cosplay, local events, anime merch
    swap/trade meets, potlucks, etc. We\u2019re always open to new ideas for meetings
    as well so feel free to participate in the discussion.\n\nNow you may be wondering,
    why A3? The 3 stands for our three tenets: culture, social, and education. We
    seek to do what other anime clubs don't. We explore the culture in anime and
    integrate it into meetings and host grounds for making friends and establishing
    bonds. Not only can we take the time to appreciate anime and manga for what it
    is, but we can also take the time to dissect them and see how to better the lives
    of others as well."
