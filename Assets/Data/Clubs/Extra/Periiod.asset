  description: "We envision a world where no student has to worry about how to manage
    their period. As an organization, we are committed to valuing all menstruating
    students at UT Dallas through education, advocacy, and service. We recognize
    that period products should not be a luxury.  Our core values are education,
    advocacy, and service.  \n\nIn terms of education, we believe all students (including
    non-menstruators) should understand the realities of menstruation. We invite
    guest speakers to our virtual meetings to help educate our student body on this
    topic. We are active on Instagram to spread more information about the menstrual
    movement as a whole.\n\nIn terms of advocacy, we believe that menstruators should
    not be disadvantaged because of their periods.  By making period products free
    and available, no student would be at an educational or financial disadvantage
    simply because it\u2019s \u201Cthat time of the month.\u201D Our greatest hope
    is to see every public restroom on the UTD campus consistently stocked with free
    period products for students. We advocate for this issue and create legislation
    to propose to UTD officials. \n\nIn terms of service, we work in conjunction
    with faculty and students to provide free hygiene products at UTD.  We hope that
    no student will ever miss class or sit home in discomfort because they can\u2019t
    access menstrual products. We rely on student participation and community donations
    in order to make this process of service a reality."
