  description: 'JLA is an educational club designed to help any UTD students, faculty,
    or staff improve their Japanese language skills. This could range from members
    completely new to the language as well as advanced students at the university
    who are simply looking to review concepts or practice conversation. JLA will
    also point members to applicable resources depending on their level. The goal
    is to prepare members for their personal goals regarding the Japanese language,
    which could be social, educational, or professional in nature. '
