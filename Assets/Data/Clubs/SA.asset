  description: The purpose of Strings Attached is to encourage students of all experience
    levels to come together and play string instruments. We aim to establish a creative
    and constructive environment for those who wish to expand their knowledge of
    string instruments and music theory. Our group will always accept people who
    enjoy playing their instruments, listening to music together, improving their
    skills, and playing actively with other members.
